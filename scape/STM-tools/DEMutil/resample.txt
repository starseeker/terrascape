This is the "next generation" of DEMtoFlat.  This program uses the
intermediate files generated in the demutils, but then resamples them
using a nearest-8 log weight resampling procedure.  This maximizes the
areal extent of the DEM to conform with UTM-based boundaries.
Personal experience has been showing that this procedure gives
extremely close approximations to the original file.

I find this program infinitely better than the original DEMtoFlat, but
it is also infinitely slower!  On a dedicated DEC ALPHA machine, one
resampling took 26 minutes, on a moderately loaded Sun ss1+ with 16
Meg RAM, it took nearly a day.  

A sorting algo for the data is the only way to speed this up, when I
get the time I may implement this.  One key in this program is that it
can be easily modified to "suture" multiple adjacent DEM's together.
It shouldn't require more than 3 or 4 added lines of code and 3 or 4
modifications to the existing code.

Again, I tried my best to make this as totally portable as possible.
It has been tested under OSF/1, SUNOS 4.x, Linux 0.99pl9, DJGPP 1.10
for DOS.

Hope this is useful.  As before, use it, distribute it, whatever, but
I would appreciate EMail that you are using it so I know how many are
using it and for what uses -- perhaps as an impetus to make more
improvements.
